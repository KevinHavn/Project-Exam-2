# Holidaze

Holidaze is a website made to allow both the management of venues, and also booking of venues. This was the project where I properly learned to use both TailwindCSS and React, and it culminates in a decent project.

## Description

Holidaze is a comprehensive platform for managing and booking holiday venues. The site allows venue managers to upload and manage their venues with detailed descriptions, availability, and pricing. Users can explore different venues, search based on location and date, and make secure bookings directly through the site. Venue managers benefit from an intuitive dashboard that simplifies the management process, while users enjoy an easy-to-navigate interface to find and book their ideal holiday spots.

Built with React and styled using TailwindCSS, Holidaze showcases modern web development practices and efficient design principles. The project represents a significant learning milestone, combining both frontend and backend skills to deliver a robust application. It includes features like user authentication, secure payment processing, and responsive design to cater to users on various devices. Additionally, the application leverages Vite for fast and optimized builds, ensuring a smooth and responsive user experience.
